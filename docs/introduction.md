# Introduction to Programming

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++.

Example:
```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### How does computer work?

2 main components of a computer are hardware and software. Hardware is the physical parts of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, and hard drive. Software is the set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is divided into two categories: application software and system software. Application software is a program that performs a specific task, such as word processing or accounting. System software is the operating system, which controls the basic functions of the computer.

### What is a programming language?

A programming language is a set of rules that allows a programmer to write instructions for a computer to execute. There are many different programming languages, each with its own set of rules and syntax. Some of the most popular programming languages include Java, Python, C++, and SQL.

Codes below are examples of how to print "Hello, World!" in different programming languages:


```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```cs
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### What is code & syntax?

Code is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Code is written in a programming language, which has its own set of rules and syntax. Syntax is the set of rules that govern how code is written. Each programming language has its own syntax, which must be followed in order for the code to be executed correctly.


### What is a code editor?

A code editor is a program that allows a programmer to write, edit, and save code. Code editors often have features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools to help the programmer write code more efficiently.

### What is code execution?

Code execution is the process of running a program on a computer. When a program is executed, the computer reads the code and follows the instructions to perform a task. If there are any errors in the code, the program may not run correctly or may produce unexpected results.

### How JavaScript is executed?

JavaScript is a programming language that is executed by a web browser. When a web page is loaded, the browser reads the JavaScript code and executes it to perform tasks such as updating the page content, handling user input, and interacting with the server.

OR

JavaScript can also be executed by a server using Node.js. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser. Node.js is often used to build server-side applications and APIs.
